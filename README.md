Introduction
============

This library packages `select2`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`select2`: https://select2.github.io/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.select2`) are published to some URL.
